More Details

JavaScript Fundamentals
ES6+ Features

Arrow Functions: Shorter syntax for writing functions. They do not have their own this context.
javascript
Copy code
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
Destructuring: Extracting values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables.
javascript
Copy code
const person = { name: 'John', age: 30 };
const { name, age } = person;
Spread/Rest Operators: Spread (...) is used to expand an array or object, and rest (...) is used to collect multiple elements into an array.
javascript
Copy code
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
const newArr = [...arr, 4, 5];
const [first, ...rest] = arr;
Template Literals: String literals allowing embedded expressions.
javascript
Copy code
const greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;
Classes: Syntactic sugar over JavaScript’s prototype-based inheritance.
javascript
Copy code
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
  greet() {
    return `Hello, ${this.name}`;
  }
}
Modules: Importing and exporting functionalities.
javascript
Copy code
// Export
export const add = (a, b) => a + b;

// Import
import { add } from './math';
Promises and Async/Await

Promises: Represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation.
javascript
Copy code
const fetchData = () => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve('data'), 1000);
  });
};
fetchData().then(data => console.log(data));
Async/Await: Syntax to work with promises in a more synchronous fashion.
javascript
Copy code
const fetchData = async () => {
  const data = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  return data.json();
};
fetchData().then(data => console.log(data));
React Basics
Components

Functional vs. Class Components: Functional components are simpler and do not have their own state or lifecycle methods until hooks were introduced.
javascript
Copy code
// Functional Component
const MyComponent = () => <div>Hello</div>;

// Class Component
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <div>Hello</div>;
  }
}
Component Lifecycle Methods: Methods that get called at different stages of a component’s life in class components.
javascript
Copy code
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    // Called after the component is mounted
  }
  render() {
    return <div>Hello</div>;
  }
}
State and Props

State: A component’s state is an object that determines how that component renders & behaves.
javascript
Copy code
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  state = { count: 0 };
  render() {
    return <div>{this.state.count}</div>;
  }
}
Props: Short for properties, props are read-only attributes that get passed to components.
javascript
Copy code
const MyComponent = (props) => <div>{props.message}</div>;
Hooks

useState: Hook for state management in functional components.
javascript
Copy code
const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return <div>{count}</div>;
};
useEffect: Hook for performing side effects in functional components.
javascript
Copy code
const MyComponent = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    // ComponentDidMount equivalent
  }, []);
  return <div>Hello</div>;
};
useContext: Hook for using context in functional components.
javascript
Copy code
const MyComponent = () => {
  const value = useContext(MyContext);
  return <div>{value}</div>;
};
JSX

JSX Syntax: A syntax extension for JavaScript, similar to XML or HTML.
javascript
Copy code
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
React Native Specifics

const MyComponent = () => (
  <ScrollView>
    <Text>Item 1</Text>
    <Text>Item 2</Text>
  </ScrollView>
);
FlatList: An optimized list for displaying large data sets.
javascript
Copy code
import { FlatList } from 'react-native';
const data = [{key: '1', name: 'Item 1'}, {key: '2', name: 'Item 2'}];
const MyComponent = () => (
  <FlatList
    data={data}
    renderItem={({item}) => <Text>{item.name}</Text>}
  />
);
Styling

Flexbox Layout: React Native uses a subset of CSS for styling, primarily flexbox for layout.
javascript
Copy code
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
});
const MyComponent = () => <View style={styles.container} />;
Navigation

React Navigation: A popular library for navigation in React Native apps.

import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';
import { createStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/stack';

const Stack = createStackNavigator();

const HomeScreen = ({ navigation }) => (
  <View>
    <Text>Home Screen</Text>
    <Button title="Go to Details" onPress={() => navigation.navigate('Details')} />
  </View>
);

const DetailsScreen = () => <Text>Details Screen</Text>;

const MyComponent = () => (
  <NavigationContainer>
    <Stack.Navigator>
      <Stack.Screen name="Home" component={HomeScreen} />
      <Stack.Screen name="Details" component={DetailsScreen} />
    </Stack.Navigator>
  </NavigationContainer>

Common Interview Questions
JavaScript and React

Explain the difference between state and props.

State is a local data storage that is local to the component and can be changed (mutable).
Props are a way to pass data from parent to child components and are read-only (immutable).
How does the virtual DOM work in React?

The virtual DOM is a lightweight representation of the real DOM. React keeps a virtual DOM to optimize updates and only updates the actual DOM when necessary.
Describe the use of React hooks and provide examples of their use.

Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. Example: useState, useEffect.
What is the context API and when would you use it?

The context API provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.
React Native

How do you style components in React Native?

Using the StyleSheet API or inline styles.
javascript
Copy code
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: 'white',
  },
});
Explain the differences between ScrollView and FlatList.

ScrollView loads all content into memory, suitable for small lists. FlatList is optimized for large lists, rendering only visible items.
How do you handle navigation in a React Native app?

Using libraries like React Navigation to create stack, tab, or drawer navigators.
Describe how to make API calls and handle responses in React Native.

Using fetch or axios to perform asynchronous HTTP requests and handling responses using .then or async/await.
Problem-Solving and Code Challenges

Given a mockup, how would you implement it in React Native?

Break down the mockup into components, style them using flexbox, and manage layout and state accordingly.
Code a simple counter app using hooks.

javascript
Copy code
const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={() => setCount(count + 1)} />
    </View>
  );
};
Write a function to fetch and display data from an API endpoint.

javascript
Copy code
const DataFetchingComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);
  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
      const result = await response.json();
      setData(result);
    };
    fetchData();
  }, []);
  return (
    <FlatList
      data={data}
      renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.name}</Text>}
      keyExtractor={item => item.id}
    />
  );
};
Practical Tips
